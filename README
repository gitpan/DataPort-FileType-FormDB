1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the
    "DataPort::FileType::FormDB" module, extends the Perl language.

    The "DataPort::FileType::FormDB" program module accesses a text database
    file in the very specific FormDB format and inherits generic database
    methods from the "DataPort::DataFile" module. The
    "DataPort::FileType::FormDB" program module is a data source for the
    "DataPort::DataFile" module.

    The FormDB format has improve flexability and performance over other
    text base formats such as the Comma Separated Variable (CSV) format.

    The text format resembles as much as possible the standard hard copy
    forms. An example of a "DatatPort::FIleType::FormDB record follows:

     manhood length: ________ ^
     time spent in big house: _________ ^

     what drugs do you use:
     _________ 
     _________ 

     ^

     ~-~

    The ':' separates field names and field content. The '^' tags the end of
    a field and the '~-~' tags the end of the record. The separation
    sequences are escaped within the form by adding an extra character as
    follows:

      sequence  escaped
      --------  --------
      ~-~       ~--~
      ~--~      ~---~
      ^         ^^
      ^^        ^^^
      :         :
      ::        :::

    Since ~-~ never appears inside a record, Perl can very easily find the
    record separators just by ... well ... searching for it. The search for
    the end of field and end of field name are just a little bit more
    complicated. Search for a ':' or '^' all by itself. Escaping and
    unescaping is just adding one more ':', '^', '-' or removing one of
    these characters.

    The FormDB record looks very much like a hard copy form yet is very
    simple and straight forward for Perl or any other programming language
    to process.

        Hello, Samson Monaco Tutankhamen! Thanks for uploading your works to
        CPAN.

        I noticed that the test suite seem to fail without these modules:

        STD::Tester

        As such, adding the prerequisite module(s) to 'PREREQ_PM' in your
        Makefile.PL should solve this problem. For example:

         WriteMakefile(
            AUTHOR      => 'Samson Monaco Tutankhamen (support@SoftwareDiamonds.com)',
            ... # other information
            PREREQ_PM   => {
                'STD::Tester'   => '0', # or a minimum workable version
            }
         );

        If you are interested in making a more flexible Makefile.PL that can
        probe for missing dependencies and install them,
        ExtUtils::AutoInstall at
        <http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=ExtUtils-AutoInstall> may be
        worth a look.

        Thanks! :-)

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        CORRECTIVE ACTION:

        The Makefile.PL is automatically generated by ExtUtils::SVDmaker
        from the data stored in the DataPort::FileType::FormDB format in the
        Docs::Site_SVD::DataPort-FormDB module. For now, in
        Docs::Site_SVD::DataPort-FormDB

        Changed

         PREREQ_PM: ^

        to

         PREREQ_PM:
         'Test::TestUtil' => 0,
         'Test::Tester' => 0,
         ^

        and regenerated the distribution using ExtUtils::SVDmaker

        Uploaded Test::TestUtil and Test::Tester to CPAN in order to resolve
        the prerequiste.

    DataPort_FormDB 0.03
        Resolved a CPAN namespace conflict by changing the name of
        Test::Tester to Test::Tech.

    DataPort_FormDB 0.04
        Changed the name of "Test::Tester" to "Test::Tech". The name
        "Test::Tester" is taken on CPAN as an upload.

        Broke up the STD support utilities "Test::TestUtil" into
        "File::FileUtil", "Test::STD::Scrub" and "Test::STD::STDutil"

        Theses changes impacted the test software.

    DataPort_FormDB 0.05
        *   Broke "DataPort::DataFile" away into its own module.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.
